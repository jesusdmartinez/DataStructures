Day 2: Data Structures
======================


## Intro

The goal for the day is to learn about the inner workings of some elementary data structures. We will study them in class and then you will implement them yourself.

We will cover:

- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List


## Assignment

Today your goal is to implement the data structures covered in class.

You should provide a full implementation with correct code, code comments and doc strings as well as unit tests to ensure your code works.

Start with implementing the Stack datastructure.

Implement stack.py and test your implementation in test_stack.py. There is a sample test in there to get you started.

Repeat for the remaining datastructures.

Happy Hacking!
